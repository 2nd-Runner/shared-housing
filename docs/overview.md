#### Background & Client Request

LA Family Housing engaged the help fo Hack for LA organization to identify and design a more efficient & effective solution for matching multiple individuals who experience homelessness as potential co-tenants and placing the matched individuals in suitable shared housing units.

#### Current Matching Process - Pain Points

* Process is manual \(vetting & matching is done manually, via discussions among case managers\)
* Process takes too long \(~1 month from unit identification to lease signing\)
* Eligibility criteria are not clearly defined \(what criteria make for a successfull tenant match?\)
